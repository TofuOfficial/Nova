# Nova
A bare bones game engine.
Inspired by [Cherno's game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)

# Contribution
*Note: you must have [premake 15 alpha](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha15) installed on your machine before doing this.*

If you want to contribute to the making of this game engine I use the premake build system. Double click the ``GeneratePrj.bat`` and it will generate a .sln file.
